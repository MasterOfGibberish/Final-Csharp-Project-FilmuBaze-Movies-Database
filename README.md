#C-Sharp-Learning-Last-Week
Final steps mastering C#!

This is my Final Project in order to finish ,,Vilnius Coding Academy". I have taken the Vilnius Coding School C# programming course (which lasted 9 weeks in total) from Vilnius CODING School! Thus, this is the code of my final project. C# was used for the back-end, XAML for front-end, and SQL database. The project can be seen in the branches (loginscreen folder).
